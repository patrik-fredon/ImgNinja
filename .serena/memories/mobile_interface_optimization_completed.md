  - Swipe left/right to compare original vs converted images
  - Visual swipe indicators and instructions
  - Smooth transition animations
  - Mobile-specific layout optimizations
  - Quick comparison dots for rapid switching

### 6. Mobile Conversion Queue
- **MobileConversionQueue** (`src/components/converter/MobileConversionQueue.tsx`)
  - Swipe-to-reveal actions (download, remove)
  - Touch-optimized item interactions
  - Visual feedback for swipe gestures
  - Haptic feedback on actions
  - Mobile-friendly progress indicators

### 7. Mobile Format Selector
- **MobileFormatSelector** (`src/components/converter/MobileFormatSelector.tsx`)
  - Swipeable carousel for format selection
  - Visual format cards with benefits
  - Navigation dots for direct selection
  - Swipe indicators and instructions
  - Format comparison information

## Enhanced Mobile Styles

### CSS Optimizations (`src/app/globals.css`)
- Safe area inset utilities for notched devices
- Touch-optimized scrolling
- Enhanced tap targets (44px minimum)
- Mobile-specific transitions and animations
