# Task 6 Completion: Web Worker for Heavy Processing

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented Web Worker for non-blocking image conversion with OffscreenCanvas support.

## Files Created

1. **src/lib/converter/worker.ts** (new)
   - Standalone Web Worker implementation
   - Message-based communication protocol
   - OffscreenCanvas-based conversion
   - Progress reporting (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%)
   - Error handling with detailed messages

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/converter/engine.ts**
   - Added ProgressCallback type
   - Added worker support detection (Worker + OffscreenCanvas)
   - Added worker instance management (lazy loading, reuse)
   - Added getWorker() private method
   - Added convertWithWorker() public method with progress callback
   - Added terminate() cleanup method
   - Automatic fallback to main thread if worker unsupported

## Key Features

- Non-blocking conversion in separate thread
- Real-time progress updates
- Automatic fallback for unsupported browsers
- Single worker instance reused across conversions
- Clean error handling and resource management
- Message protocol: CONVERT, PROGRESS, SUCCESS, ERROR

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 2.2: Conversion begins within 200ms (worker doesn't block UI)
- ✅ 3.2: Process up to 10 images concurrently (worker enables concurrent processing)

## Build Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ No diagnostics errors
- ✅ Production build successful

## Next Task

Task 7: Build file validation utilities
