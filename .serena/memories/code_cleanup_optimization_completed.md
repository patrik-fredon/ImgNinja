# Code Cleanup and Optimization Foundation - Completed

## Task Summary
Successfully completed Task 1: Code Cleanup and Optimization Foundation from the modern-conversion-optimization spec.

## Completed Work

### 1. Dead Code Removal
- **Removed unused FileUploadSkeleton component** - was not imported or used anywhere
- **Removed unused webpack-bundle-analyzer dependency** - replaced with @next/bundle-analyzer
- **Dependency analysis script** created to identify unused dependencies

### 2. Bundle Analysis and Tree Shaking
- **Enhanced Next.js configuration** with advanced webpack optimizations:
  - Tree shaking enabled (`usedExports: true`, `sideEffects: false`)
  - Optimized code splitting with vendor and common chunks
  - Bundle analyzer integration with @next/bundle-analyzer
- **Added bundle analysis scripts**:
  - `npm run analyze` - analyze bundle with Next.js bundle analyzer
  - `npm run analyze:deps` - analyze dependencies for unused packages

### 3. Component Pattern Consolidation
- **Created lazy-wrapper utility** (`src/lib/utils/lazy-wrapper.tsx`) to consolidate duplicate lazy loading patterns
- **Refactored lazy components** to use the new utility:
  - LazyQualityControl
  - LazyFormatSelector  
  - LazyConversionQueue
- **Reduced code duplication** by ~60 lines across lazy components

### 4. Performance Monitoring Setup
- **Enhanced PerformanceMonitor component** with comprehensive monitoring
- **Created BundleMonitor utility** (`src/lib/performance/bundle-monitor.ts`) for:
  - Bundle size tracking
  - Core Web Vitals monitoring (FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB)
  - Resource loading performance
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Long task detection
- **Analytics integration** ready for Google Analytics

### 5. Build Optimization
- **Next.js experimental features** enabled:
  - `optimizeCss: true`
  - `optimizePackageImports` for @/components and @/lib
  - `scrollRestoration: true`
- **Advanced webpack configuration** for production optimization

### 6. Code Quality Tools
- **Biome linter/formatter** configured and integrated
- **Dependency analysis script** for ongoing maintenance
- **Comprehensive optimization script** for automated cleanup

## Scripts Added
- `npm run analyze` - Bundle analysis
- `npm run analyze:deps` - Dependency analysis  
- `npm run optimize` - Comprehensive codebase optimization
- `npm run cleanup` - Full cleanup pipeline (optimize + deps + lint + format)

## Performance Improvements
- **Bundle size optimization** through tree shaking and code splitting
- **Lazy loading** for 4 components with consolidated pattern
- **Performance monitoring** with real-time metrics
- **Memory usage tracking** and optimization warnings

## Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Production build successful  
- ✅ All routes generated correctly
- ✅ No unused dependencies detected
- ✅ Code formatting and linting configured

## Next Steps
The foundation is now ready for implementing the remaining tasks in the spec:
- Modern Design System Implementation (Task 2)
- Enhanced Hero Section (Task 3)
- Smart File Upload Interface (Task 4)
- And subsequent optimization tasks

## Files Modified/Created
- `next.config.ts` - Enhanced with optimization features
- `package.json` - Added optimization scripts
- `biome.json` - Linter/formatter configuration
- `src/lib/performance/bundle-monitor.ts` - New performance monitoring
- `src/lib/utils/lazy-wrapper.tsx` - New lazy loading utility
- `src/components/ui/PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Enhanced monitoring
- `scripts/analyze-dependencies.js` - Dependency analysis tool
- `scripts/optimize-codebase.js` - Comprehensive optimization tool
- Removed: `src/components/converter/FileUploadSkeleton.tsx` (unused)
