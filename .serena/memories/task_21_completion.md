# Task 21 Completion: Implement Sitemap Generation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Task Requirements Met:
- ✅ Create app/sitemap.ts with dynamic route generation
- ✅ Include all locale-prefixed routes (cs, en)
- ✅ Add format information pages to sitemap
- ✅ Set appropriate priorities and change frequencies

### Implementation Details:
- **File**: `src/app/sitemap.ts` (already existed and was correctly implemented)
- **Dynamic generation**: Uses `getSupportedFormats()` to include all 5 formats
- **Locales**: Supports both 'cs' and 'en' with proper alternates
- **Routes included**:
  - Homepage: `/{locale}` (priority: 1.0, weekly)
  - Privacy: `/{locale}/privacy` (priority: 0.5, monthly)
  - Formats: `/{locale}/formats/{format}` (priority: 0.7, monthly)
- **Internationalization**: Proper alternates for both languages

### Technical Notes:
- Follows Next.js MetadataRoute.Sitemap specification
- Uses environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL with fallback
- Includes proper lastModified, changeFrequency, and priority values
- Implementation was already complete from previous session

### Requirements Satisfied:
- Requirement 5.5: Generate sitemap including all public pages ✅

The sitemap implementation is production-ready and follows Next.js best practices.
